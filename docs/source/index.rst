Welcome to SAX4BPM's documentation!
===================================
SAX4BPM is an open-source Python library catering for business-process oriented explainability of process aware systems. It includes a module for process model discovery and a module supporting
discovery of causal-execution dependency model. In the nearest future we will add causal-model driven XAI explainability module and integrate all perspectives together into single
higher-level human-understandable LLM-supported view.
