        Transpose the original event log so that each column is activity name and the value is the timestamp of the activity. Calculate all possible pairs of activities
        within this process and all its variants which happen one after the other. For each part, across all variants holding this pair, compute the time diff with the 
        parent activity of the pair. Apply causal discovery algorithm of the subframe defined by the parent activity and the pair of activities and the time diff between them. 
        This will be a single coefficient in the adjacenty matrix of the whole process. At the end create global adjacency matrix out of all coefficients.
