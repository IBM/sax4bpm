Prior Knowledge
=================================================
This module contains implementation of a :class:`sax.core.causal_process_discovery.prior_knowledge.PriorKnowledge` class. This class should be instantiated with the event log data 
passed to causal discovery algorithm in case we want this algorithm to take into account specific business-process constraints (such as known time precedence between activities in the process)
