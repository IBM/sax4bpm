**This is a designated Python library that aims to provide an easy and intuitive way of deriving explanations about business processes, considering multiple perspectives. Concretely, three major knowledge ingredients—a process model, a causal process model, and XAI attribute ranking—are derived and subsequently synthesized by an LLM for the construction of process and context-aware explanations, namely Situation-aware Explanations (SAX explanations).**
